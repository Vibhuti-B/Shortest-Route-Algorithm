1. Input file for the algorithm is Graph.graph is a tab separated file comprising of following information:
Number of Nodes Number of Edges
Starting Node Ending Node Edge Weight

2. Djiktras.py- Accepts the Graph as input, processes the file and generates a shortest path from starting node to all the other nodes. The output is Distance and Shortest Path for each vertex.

3. Prims.py- Accepts the Graph as input, processes the file and generates a Pre-order tree traversal of Minimum spanning tree from starting node.
